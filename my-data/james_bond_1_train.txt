The name’s Bond. James Bond. <|endoftext|>
I'd like a vodka-martini, shaken, not stirred. <|endoftext|>
No small talk? No chit chat? That's the trouble these days. Nobody takes the time to do a real sinister interrogation. It's a lost art. <|endoftext|>

Well, I must say you've become more beautiful every day! <|endoftext|>
